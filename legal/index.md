### 1. Introduction
With Project (“we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our mobile application (the “With”).

### 2. Information We Collect

**2.1 Information You Provide**  
- **Account Information:** When you sign up using Google or Apple Sign‑In, we collect your email address and basic profile information (username, display name, profile picture) that you choose to provide.  
- **Hangout Content:** Photos, videos, captions, and timestamps you post when creating hangout moments.  
- **Social Connections:** Information about your friend relationships and hangout participants.

**2.2 Automatically Collected Information**  
- **Usage Data:** Information about how you interact with the App, including hangout creation, friend connections, and participation in social moments.  
- **Device Information:** Basic device information necessary for app functionality.  
- **Authentication Tokens:** Secure tokens used to maintain your login session.

**2.3 Social Points Data**  
We calculate and store social points based on your hangout participation, friend connections, and social activity. This data is used solely to provide the social presence signaling feature of the App.

### 3. How We Collect Information
We collect information through:
- **Direct Input:** When you create an account, post hangouts, or interact with the App.  
- **Authentication Services:** When you sign in using Google or Apple Sign‑In (handled securely through Supabase).  
- **Automatic Collection:** Through your use of the App’s features and functionality.

### 4. How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect to:
- **Provide Core Services:** Enable hangout posting, friend connections, and social presence signaling.  
- **Maintain Your Account:** Manage your profile, authentication, and account settings.  
- **Calculate Social Points:** Generate and display your social standing score based on your activity.  
- **Facilitate Social Connections:** Enable you to connect with friends and participate in shared hangout moments.  
- **Improve the App:** Analyze usage patterns to enhance functionality and user experience.  
- **Ensure Security:** Protect against fraud, abuse, and security threats.

### 5. Data Sharing and Third Parties

**5.1 Third‑Party Service Providers**  
We share your data with the following third‑party service providers who help us operate the App:

- **Supabase:** We use Supabase for database storage (user profiles, hangouts, friend relationships), user authentication (OAuth with Google/Apple), and media file storage (photos and videos). Supabase is bound by their own privacy policy and security standards. You can review Supabase’s privacy practices at: <https://supabase.com/privacy>  
- **Google/Apple:** When you choose to sign in with Google or Apple, these providers process your authentication. Their use of your information is governed by their respective privacy policies:  
  - Google: <https://policies.google.com/privacy>  
  - Apple: <https://www.apple.com/privacy/>

**5.2 Data Protection Standards**  
All third‑party service providers with whom we share your data are contractually required to provide the same or equal protection of your data as stated in this Privacy Policy. They are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than providing services to us.

**5.3 Data Sharing with Other Users**  
Your hangout posts and profile information are visible only to users you have explicitly connected with as friends or who are participants in the same hangout moments. We do not share your data publicly or with users outside your social connections. The App operates as a semi‑private social layer where data sharing is limited to confirmed relationships.

**5.4 No Sale of Data**  
We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.

### 6. Data Retention and Deletion

**6.1 Data Retention**  
We retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We may retain certain information after account deletion as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (such as preventing fraud or abuse).

**6.2 Account and Data Deletion**  
You have the right to delete your account and all associated data at any time. To delete your account:  
- **Within the App:** Navigate to Settings → Account → Delete Account

When you delete your account:
- All your personal information is permanently removed from our systems  
- Your hangout posts and media are deleted  
- Your authentication is revoked  
- Your social points and activity history are removed  
This action is irreversible—deleted data cannot be recovered.

**6.3 Data Deletion Timeline**  
Account deletion is processed immediately upon request. All associated data is removed from active systems within 30 days, except where retention is required by law.

### 7. Your Rights and Choices
You have the following rights regarding your personal information:
- **Access:** You can view your profile information and data through the App.  
- **Correction:** You can update your profile information at any time through the App settings.

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information:
- **Encryption:** Data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.  
- **Authentication:** Secure authentication via industry‑standard OAuth protocols.  
- **Access Controls:** Limited access to personal data on a need‑to‑know basis.  
- **Regular Security Reviews:** Ongoing assessment and improvement of security measures.

However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100 % secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### 9. Children’s Privacy
The App is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately, and we will delete such information.

### 10. International Data Transfers
Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence. These countries may have data protection laws that differ from those in your country. By using the App, you consent to the transfer of your information to these countries.

**13.2 Analytics**
